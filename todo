- builder creeps variable to choose most damages or nearest target to repair
- more dynamic/elegant choice of what energy to pick when
- pick up more energy if available in close range even if threshold is hit after first pickup
- dynamic creep build-up, creep amount and other configs in relation to existing buildings & level
- panic mode when attacked
- tower defense against draining
- tower repair usage
- have room-global variable if roads are done, if so dynamically adjust creep builds to save energy where possible
- make creeps reserve energy once they start moving (?)
- Make ramparts have different HP minimum depending on the structure theyre placed on. 
- Enable creep flee for workers
- Enable creep flee for attackers if enemy too strong (and send reinforcement?)
- Enable swarm logic, so healers and attackers work together logically
- Program a 'constant attack' flag
- Make a creep who steals
